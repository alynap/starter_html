        <h3>Geographical location: Europe</h3>
        <p>Barcelona, is a beautiful city on the Northeastern coast of Spain that is the byproduct of a rich and artistic history with 
          modern infrastructure. One of the main attractions of the city is its gorgeous architecture, often the work of world renowned 
          architects such as Antoni Gaudi. Some of the most notable works are the modern Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, and the tranquil 
          and eloquent Park Güell.
        </p>

        <p>Much of Barcelona’s charm comes down to local culture, from diverse culinary offerings, to the sunny vacation-ridden atmosphere 
          of the beaches, and even the symbolism of nationalism and independence that Barcelona residents display. The passion of the locals 
          is unwavering, including in famous soccer matches by one of the sports greatest clubs: F.C. Barcelona, and in numerous local artistry
           events. It is no wonder why many travelers to Spain feel rejuvenated and fortunate enough to have experienced the city’s irresistibly
            strong culture and atmosphere.
